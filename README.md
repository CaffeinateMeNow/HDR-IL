# deep_imitation_learning_robotics (HDR-IL)

Code for NeurIPS 2020 paper titled Deep Imitation Learning for Bimanual Robotic Manipulation

Code is written with PyTorch. Data can be generated using the "Simulation Code"



The prediction models are titled Table_Lift_HDR-IL for the table lifting task, and Peg In Hole HDR-IL for the peg-in-hole task referenced in the paper. Detials about training the model can be found in the "Model Readme.txt"

All code for generating training data is found in the "simulations" folder. This folder also contains the necessary URDF components to build the simulations, as well as scripts to visualize ground truth and predicted simulations.
